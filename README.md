Cirno's Perfect Math Library
====
### Adapated for Minetest
Various useful bits of game math. 3D line intersections, ray casting, 2d/3d vectors, 4x4 matrices, quaternions, etc.

Intended to be used with LuaJIT and LÖVE (this is the backbone of LÖVE3D).

Online documentation can be found [here](http://excessive.github.io/cpml/) or you can generate them yourself using `ldoc -c doc/config.ld -o index .`

### TODO:
* Vec3s and Vec2s are not currently adapted for functionality with MT vectors (seperate classes)
